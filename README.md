## Getting started

- Install Neovim. You can use (this configuration)[https://github.com/frdwhite24/nvim/tree/meetup] if you'd like. Otherwise, find another way to (install Neovim)[https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md] and just use a fresh, empty configuration.
- Head to `./exercises` and run through the exercises in order, trying to complete them in as few keystrokes as possible. Hint: you can open a file by running `neovim ./exercises/01_basic_movements.py`, or by opening Neovim with `nvim` and then typing `:e ./exercises/01_basic_movements.py`
- You can check the solutions in `./solutions`.
