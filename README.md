## Getting started

- Install Neovim. You can use [this configuration](https://github.com/frdwhite24/nvim/tree/meetup) if you'd like. Otherwise, find another way to [install Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) or use the default vim installation that's included on your machine if there is one.
- Head to `./exercises` and run through the exercises in order, trying to complete them in as few keystrokes as possible. Hint: you can open a file by running `nvim ./exercises/01_basic_movements.py`, or by opening Neovim with `nvim` and then typing `:e ./exercises/01_basic_movements.py` and pressing enter to run the command.
- You can check the solutions in `./solutions`.
